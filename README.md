<h1>Health Insurance Pricing Prediction <img src="https://cdn.eduadvisor.my/institution/mmu/ea-inst-logo-mmu.png" alt="Logo" style="height: 50px; vertical-align: middle;"></h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Insurance serves as a vital tool for managing risk and protecting against financial loss, particularly in today's fast-paced world filled with uncertainties. The recent coronavirus pandemic has heightened the importance of understanding health insurance pricing, making it a critical area of study.</p>
<p>This project focuses on predicting health insurance pricing using machine learning techniques, specifically on a dataset derived from the US Health Insurance market. By applying various regression-based algorithms, we aim to ensure that insurance companies can offer competitive yet profitable health insurance packages.</p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Analyze health insurance pricing in the context of risk management.</li>
    <li>Utilize regression algorithms to predict pricing effectively.</li>
    <li>Ensure profitability in health insurance offerings for companies.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Methodology</h2>
<p>We explore four regression-based machine learning algorithms due to their proven performance:</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Multiple Linear Regression</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Ridge Regression</strong></li>
    <li><strong>XGBoost Regression</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Random Forest Regression</strong></li>
</ol>

<h3>Evaluation Metrics</h3>
<p>The model performance is assessed using the following metrics:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Mean Absolute Error (MAE)</li>
    <li>Mean Squared Error (MSE)</li>
    <li>Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)</li>
    <li>RÂ² Score</li>
</ul>

<h3>Results</h3>
<p>Our findings reveal that Random Forest Regression outperforms all other algorithms across all four evaluation metrics. Further enhancements through hyperparameter tuning improve performance in three of the four metrics, except for MAE.</p>

<h2>Data Visualization</h2>
<p>To enrich our analysis, we employ data visualizations that highlight:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The importance of various features affecting pricing.</li>
    <li>A comparison of actual vs. predicted insurance prices.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>This project not only demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning in predicting health insurance pricing but also provides actionable insights for insurance companies to optimize their offerings. By utilizing advanced regression techniques and data visualizations, we aim to contribute to better decision-making in health insurance pricing.</p>
